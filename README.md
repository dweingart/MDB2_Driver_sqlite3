MDB2_Driver_sqlite3
===================

This is an MDB2 Driver for SQLite3.

The SQLite driver available from PEAR only works with obsolete SQLite 2 databases. This 
driver works with SQLite3 databases.

This is not my work. It was written by the ownCloud[1] team and used up until version 5. 
ownCloud no longer uses MDB2 in current releases. The version of the files here are from 
here: https://github.com/owncloud/core/tree/v5.0.13/lib/MDB2

All I've done is to move the files to a single repository for the sake of convenience.
